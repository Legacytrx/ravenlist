Tasklist for Ravencoin

Ravencoin is a new coin started in 2018. It is truely opensource and fair. In order to structure potential work around ravencoin (not ravencoin itself) there is the idea to use Github and the issue list in order to identify tasks and to have the possibility for people to sign up for this tasks. The list should reflect what is needed and then also who works on it and in what stage the work is.

So how does it work:
Each task should be an own issue. Just create it. The is a possibility to have a task list in the comment field in the following format:
  - [ ] Item1
  - [ ] Item2
  - [ ] Item3
  - [ ] Final Item
This could show how the task is progressing.
Comment can be used to show what is currently been done, links to what ever, contacts etc.
